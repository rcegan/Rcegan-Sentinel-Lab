# Discord Webhook Notifications
---
![](SentinelDiscordNotification.png)

This logic app takes incidents generated by Sentinel and sends them to a Discord Webhook. Please ensure you create an automation rule to invoke this playbook.

You may wish to modify:
* The MSTAT step (you can remove or skip if you don't use it - it doesn't get referenced in this logic app, I just include it out of habit..)
* Modify the fields in the HTML to reflect your environment
* Change the time zone step to convert to your timezone
* The icon URL. I'm using a random Sentinel logo I found on Google.
